// use strict 
// This was the case until 2009 when ECMAScript 5 (ES5) appeared. It added new features to the language and modified some of the existing ones. To keep the old code working, most such modifications are off by default. You need to explicitly enable them with a special directive: "use strict". 
// this code works the modern way
/* 'use strict'

x = 75  // ReferenceError 
console.log(x)

console.log(window.x)

alert(x) */

/* function myfunction() {
    'use strict';
    y = 3.14  // ReferenceError 
}
myfunction()
 */

/* y = 3.14  // notError 
'use strict' */
